# OTT Content Analysis

## Introduction

The way we consume videos has undergone massive changes. Now we have multiple OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+ to stream TV shows and movies online. In 2019, the OTT market was valued at 85.16 billion USD, and it is expected to reach 194.20 billion USD by 2025. Under COVID-19, many countries introduced social distancing measures that forced theaters to limit the number of audiences or even shut down and that encouraged people to stay at home, accelerating the increase in OTT platform subscriptions. Therefore, I thought it was the right time to analyze different OTT platforms and provide useful information for people not able to decide which platform fits them best. 

This study presents an analysis of four major OTT platforms â€” Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and Hulu. Amongst multiple factors affecting online streaming subscriptions, I mainly analyzed the content on the platforms like the Genres, TV Rating and Cast using Jupyter Notebook to explore and clean the dataset and Power BI to visualize the insights. 

## My Findings: 

1.	Amazon Prime and Netflix contains almost same amount of content. Movies are still dominant over TV Shows but there is slight drop in movies content from 2019 but TV show contents are increasing consistently.

2.	Generally, Netflix and Amazon Prime had a similar distribution in terms of genre; drama made up the biggest proportion with comedy and action following. However, Netflix still had more content across almost all genres with Amazon prime notably outnumbering Netflix only in action and romance films.

3.	We notice that Netflix has an overwhelming count of films that are rated for adult audiences, and unsuitable for children under 17. It has very few films rated as general audience. It has around 2000+ films that are suitable for teenagers of age 14 and above. Amazon Prime has a balanced distribution in terms of age rating. It has a roughly similar number of films categorized as Adults, General audience, and kids (parental guidance recommended). Hulu also contain lot of Adult and Kids movies but very less general audience. Finally, although not noticeable because it has a small number of films overall, Disney+ has no content labeled Adults and a small number of films rated TV-14. All other films are rated either kids with parental guidance, which could be watched by children with or without parental guidance.

4.	Netflix stands out when it comes to the number of countries contributing to the content, it has more than double the countries contributing than other platforms. United States contribute most for content on all platforms followed by India contributing most on Netflix and Amazon Prime and almost nothing on Hulu and Disney+.

5. Disney+ showed the most characteristic distribution. Yet, it had much smaller number of contents compared to the other two, which could be a strong push factor. It is still important to look at the shape of distribution because it signifies what to expect in the future. Disney+ clearly seems to focus on family, comedy, adventure, and animation films. It also has some action, drama, documentary, and fantasy movies but almost no movies in other genres. People who enjoy various genres may want to avoid Disney+.
